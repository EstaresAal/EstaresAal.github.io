### How to be a hotdog
As you all know. I-Aaliyah Venizze Estares is an understatement of wanting to a hotdog? And I want to ask this... Are you all tired of being the so-called human and become a hotdog? Don't worry, _hindi ka lang nag-iisa_ because 99% of my life I just want to be a hotdog in a freezer. Pero.... paano? Simple you think that you want to be a hotdog and boom! You're a hotdog like me. :)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/EstaresAal/EstaresAal.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/EstaresAal/EstaresAal.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
