## Fancy Morning and I welcome you here!
I am Aaliyah Estares and I will take about things I am well.... interested in talking about, so buckle up because this is about to get interesting. (_cringes at myself_)

### 1. How to be a hotdog
As you all know. I-Aaliyah Venizze Estares is an understatement of wanting to a hotdog? And I want to ask this... Are you all tired of being the so-called human and become a hotdog? Don't worry, _hindi ka lang nag-iisa_ because 99% of my life I just want to be a hotdog in a freezer. Pero.... paano? Simple you think that you want to be a hotdog and boom! You're a hotdog like me. :)

### 2. Paano mawala ang problems
Simple. Gunawa ka ng mas maraming problems para mawala yung unang problem na yun. Gaya sa math may tinatawag na cancelling, sa problema mo - puwede mo siya ma-cancel which is by adding more problems!

### 3. Paano hindi mahirapan sa module
Simple. Magpagawa ka sa iba. Yun tapos ka na. :)
